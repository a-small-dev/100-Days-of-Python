# Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A classic Snake Game built using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module.  
The project is structured using OOP with separate modules for the snake, food, scoring, and game logic.

## Features

- Arrow key movement  
- Randomly generated food  
- Snake grows after eating  
- Score tracking  
- Wall and self-collision detection  
- Smooth animation using `screen.tracer(0)`  
- Clean object-oriented project structure

## Skills Reinforced

- Understanding and applying object-oriented programming  
- Working with multiple Python modules and file organization  
- Using Python's `turtle` graphics for animation  
- Handling keyboard events and real-time input  
- Managing game loops and frame updates  
- Implementing collision detection
