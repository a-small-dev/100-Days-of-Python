# Python Calculator

A simple interactive calculator implemented in Python.

## Description

This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Users can continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation.  
The program also includes a logo from the `art.py` file for a polished look.

## How to Use

1. Make sure the following files are in the same folder:

       main.py
       art.py

2. Run the main script:

       python main.py

3. Follow the prompts:

   - Enter the first number.  
   - Pick an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
   - Enter the second number.  
   - Continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation by typing `y` or `n`.

## Example Output

       What's the first number?: 10
       +
       -
       *
       /
       Pick an operation: +
       What's the second number?: 5
       10 + 5 = 15
       Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
       +
       -
       *
       /
       Pick an operation: *
       What's the next number?: 3
       15 * 3 = 45
       Type 'y' to continue calculating with 45, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
